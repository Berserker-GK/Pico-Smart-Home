# TinyML Wake-Word Detection on Raspberry Pi Pico

This application implements the wake word example from
[Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers)
on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

The wake word example shows how to run a 20 kB neural network that can detect 2
keywords, "yes" and "no". More information about this example is available on
the [Tensorflow Lite Micro examples folder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech).

We use as input an electret microphone to detect the words "yes" or "no" and
turn the on-device LED on and off in response.

### Pico Microphone

This project is dependant on the `pico-microphone` library by
[Sandeep Mistry](https://github.com/sandeepmistry).
Take a look [here](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/pico-microphone) for more
information about the library.

## Overview

The `micro_speech` app for the Raspberry Pi Pico is an adaptation taken from
the "Wake-Word" example on Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers. Pete Warden's
and Daniel Situnayake's _[TinyML](https://tinymlbook.com)_ book gives an
in-depth look into how this model works and how to train your own. This
repository ports the example to work on the Pico.

The application works by listening to the microphone and processing the data
before sending it the model to be analyzed. The application takes advantage of
Pico's ADC and DMA for the analog microphone and the Pico's PIO and DMA for the
PDM microphone to listen for samples, saving the CPU to perform the complex
analysis.

The Pico does not come with an onboard microphone. For this application, we use
the Adafruit Auto-gain Electret Microphone Amplifier breakout.
## Before You Begin

We will now go through the setup of the project. This section contains three
sub-sections, hardware requirements, hardware setup and software setup.

### Hardware Requirements

#### Analog Microphone

- 1x [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
- 1x [Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX9814 with Auto Gain Control](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1713)
- 1x Micro USB cable
- 3x Jumper wires
- 2x 1x20 male header pins (for the Pico)
- 1x 1x5 male header pins (for the microphone)

#### Assembly

1. Solder headers onto your Raspberry Pi Pico
2. Solder headers onto your Adafruit Electret Microphone

#### Wiring

The electret microphone breakout is an analog input, meaning we can connect it
to one of the ADC pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Make the following connections:

##### Analog Microphone

| __Adafruit Electret Microphone__ | __Raspberry Pi Pico__ |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| OUT                          | ADC0 - Pin31      |
| GND                          | Any ground pin    |
| VDD                          | 3V3(OUT) - Pin36  |


### Software Setup

The final step before using this application is to set up the software stack
(CMake and compilers). The easiest way to do this is to follow the steps on the
Raspberry Pi Pico SDK [repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).
Once done you can test your tolchain setup by running some of the examples
found in the Pico examples
[repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples).


## Making Changes

If you would like to use a different microphone, different LED, use other pins
on Pico or change the audio quality, you will need to know how to make these
changes to the application.

### Changing the LED

The LED settings can be found in `micro_speech/rp2/command_responder.cc`. To
change the LED to a different pin (instead of the onboard LED), change the line:

```cpp
#define LED_PIN 25
```

To change the functionality of the LED, edit the `if-else` section:

```cpp
if (found_command == "yes"){
  //turn led on
  gpio_put(LED_PIN, 1);
}
else if (found_command == "no"){
  //turn led off
  gpio_put(LED_PIN, 0);
}
```

### Changing the ADC

The ADC pin is defined in the `src/audio_provider.cc` script. To
change the pin used in the application, change the lines:

```cpp
#define ADC_PIN 26
#define CAPTURE_CHANNEL 0
```

### Changing the Audio Quality

You can change the audio quality captured in the application. By default, the
Tensorflow model expects a `16kHz` quality. `16kHz` means `16000` samples every
second. Below you can see the analog config in the `src/audio_provider.cc`
file.

```cpp
const struct analog_microphone_config config = {
    // GPIO to use for input, must be ADC compatible (GPIO 26 - 28)
    .gpio = ADC_PIN + CAPTURE_CHANNEL,

    // bias voltage of microphone in volts
    .bias_voltage = 1.25,

    // sample rate in Hz
    .sample_rate = 16000,

    // number of samples to buffer
    .sample_buffer_size = ADC_BUFFER_SIZE,
};
```

You can change the different settings to best suit your need.
